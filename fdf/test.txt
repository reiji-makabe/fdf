X-WINDOW CONCEPT
 X-Window is a network-oriented graphical system for Unix. It is based on two main parts:
 On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or get keyboard & mouse  entries.
 On the other side, the X-Server manages the screen, keyboard and mouse (It is often refered to as a "display").
 A network connection must be established between these two entities to send drawing orders (from the software to the X-Server), and keyboard/mouse events (from the X-Server to the software).


INCLUDE FILE
 mlx.h should be included for a correct use of the MiniLibX API. It only contains function prototypes, no structure is needed.

LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
 First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your software and the display.
 Once this connection is established, you'll be able to use other MiniLibX functions to send the X-Server messages, like "I want to draw a yellow pixel in this window" or "did the user hit a key?".
 The mlx_init function will create this connec‚Äê tion. No parameters are needed, ant it will return a void * identifier, used for further calls to the library routines.

 All other MiniLibX functions are described in the following man pages:
 mlx_new_window : manage windows
 mlx_pixel_put : draw inside window
 mlx_new_image : manipulate images
 mlx_loop : handle keyboard or mouse events

LINKING MiniLibX
 To use MiniLibX functions, you'll need to link your software with several libraries, including the MiniLibX library itself. To do this, simply add the following arguments at linking time:

 -lmlx -lXext -lX11

 You may also need to specify the path to these libraries, using the -L flag.
